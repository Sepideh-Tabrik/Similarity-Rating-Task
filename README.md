# Visual and Tactile Object Recognition Data Processing
This repository contains MATLAB code for part of the data from the study "Visual and Tactile Sensory Systems Share Common Features in Object Recognition" by Tabrik et al., published in eNeuro (2021). The code supports the analysis of similarity judgments for 3D objects ("digital embryos") explored visually (via virtual reality) and tactually (via 3D-printed models), including multidimensional scaling (MDS) to construct perceptual spaces and correlation between similarity rating matrices.
## Virtual Reality Environment
The virtual office was furnished with a desk, which was located in front of the participants. If the participants looked toward their left, bookshelves, a printer, some books, and a monitor on a study table were visible; toward their right, there was a window with a view of the outside.

## Stimuli
To implement natural object properties and prevent evoking memories of familiar objects that might influence perceptual processing, we created naturalistic 3D objects (referred to as digital embryos) using a VP algorithm (Brady and Kersten, 2003; Hauffen et al., 2012). Digital embryos were created from a uniform icosahedron as an ancestor that was subsequently changed by simulating the biological process of embryogenesis: cell division, cell growth, and cell movement (for more details, see http://hegde.us/digital-embryos/).

## Overview
The study investigates how visual and tactile sensory systems use shared 3D shape features (e.g., curvature, volume) to recognize objects. Participants rated the similarity of object pairs, and the resulting data were used to: Construct visual and tactile perceptual spaces via MDS. Analyze correlations between modalities. mds_correlation_analysis
